    <p>At a young age, I became familiar with caring for family members. I was the youngest of 5 kids born 8 years after my nearest sister.</p>
    <h4>A losing game</h4>
    <p>As many of us, we have lost grandparents and felt the loss when artists we love die from old age. My losing game started at 26 when my father died. Being the youngest child, it was me that took care of my mother. Ten years later, I lost two brothers with just a few months between. One very suddenly and the other after 5 years of a growing brain tumor.

        I have firsthand experience as a caregiver through my entrepreneurial journey with the digital communication solution, Jodacare. With just a few taps on my smartphone, I can easily check if Mom is doing well.
        <h4>Good conversations</h4>
        As a founder, I, Kristil Erla H√•land, use the Jodacare app on my phone to have meaningful conversations with my mom, Asgj√∏rg H√•land, especially when her memory fails. For Mom, Jodacare means she gets to experience good moments throughout the day. 
        When my mother fell ill, I discovered how crucial the flow of information between caregivers and the health sector is. I identified a gap that needed filling with Jodacare, a communication tool designed to make the role of caregivers easier, streamline the work of healthcare professionals, and fill Mom‚Äôs Day with good moments.
        I‚Äôve learned a lot about what is important for caregivers through my own experiences.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h4>Communication Breakdowns</h4>
        There are many sons and daughters involved in caregiving, and often, caregivers and healthcare services end up working against each other due to poor and inadequate communication.
        My mom, Asbj√∏rg H√•land, was diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs in 2012, and I took care of her while she was still at home. When home care services became involved, I could finally relax a bit, but new challenges arose.
        When asked about her day, Mom would often say that no one had visited her, even if home care was supposed to come. She spoke so convincingly that I didn't know what to believe, leading to many phone calls to home care services to find out the truth.
        And then, I would discover that they had actually visited her twice that day.
        ‚ÄúI realized this is a problem for many others besides me.‚Äù
        I spoke with other caregivers, municipalities, institutions, and Innovation Norway. They all confirmed what I suspected ‚Äì there was a need for a new system.
        ‚ÄúWe are many involved in caregiving, and the group of elderly with dementia grows every year. We must involve caregivers more,‚Äù I assert.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h4>Just as Simple as Facebook</h4>
        In the digital contact book, you can add and send messages, pictures, calendars, and personal profiles that are easily shared from the healthcare sector with caregivers via an app on their smartphone. The system is as simple to use as Facebook but ensures personal information is securely handled.
        ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve heard from several caregivers that they check Jodacare more often than Facebook.‚Äù
        Through this system, I aim to enhance the dignity of individuals with dementia or developmental disabilities. It creates a better coherence in their lives, in their relationships with healthcare helpers, and their families through better and easily accessible communication. Caregivers can quickly find out what has been done and more easily solve challenges as they arise. For instance, when Mom refused dinner and went hungry, I could do something about it thanks to Jodacare.
        I get very happy with updates from the care home where Mom lives, and at the same time, I‚Äôm delighted with all the positive feedback I get from users from Vads√∏ in the north to Songdalen in the south.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h4>Efficient and Good Care</h4>
        Mom now lives in a care home. She has her own smartphone and gets help from the staff to use it. They look at pictures together, which creates good contact and something to talk about.
        ‚ÄúThe helpers get to know the patient better. And I see that mom enjoys looking at pictures.‚Äù
        One of the new investors from Stavanger previously invested in the oil sector but now sees welfare technology as an attractive field.
        The helpers have all the users on their phones and can easily add new messages or get information about the user. Staff find they save time when information is in one place. They can easily see what colleagues have done in the Jodacare system and check if anyone has put extra effort into taking pictures of the user‚Äôs day and uploading them.
        This can provide positive reinforcement for the other staff, inspiring each other. Clearly, it results in efficient care when everyone easily knows what needs to be done.
