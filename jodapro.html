        <h1> Jodapro app for nurses and paramedics in the field</h1>
        <h3>I want to explain how our users are using the phone apps today and how we would like to have them in the near future. The reason for this changes are the usebility of phones over headworn cameras, and the economy - we believe we could sell more apps!</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
    Today,nurses are using the app on tablets and phones to let the patient be part of the conversation when the nurse is using Jodapro head-camera, and the specialist is in the hospital. Some municipalities are also using this app for easy to connect to others in their team at the end of a shift.
</p>
<h4>New use of the app</h4>
<p>
    Nurses are often visiting patients alone, and very often they need help form a colleage to see what they see, and then get decision support. When working with patients it is crucial that the video is secure. In Norway we have to use "Norsk Helsenett" and that video solution is built on Pexip.
</p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<p>
    For the next generation Jodapro app we will let our users easily send an invite to a colleague using sms and provide with a one-time link to a video call. The link will provide the new user with an installation of the Jodapro app so it is set up for this all and allows that nurse to use the Jodapro app again next time he needs help from a colleague.

<br/>
<br/>
When the user has sendt the sms to a colleage, the sms has a one-time link to a new video room in "Norsk Helsenett" where they will meet.

    <h4>Economy</h4>
<p>
    We have learned from the few years Jodapro has been in the ambulances and in homecare that this kind of app is missing. We will provide each customer (municipalities and ambulances) with their own adminpanel login so they can keep track of users. Jodatech  will get paid pr user of the apps.
